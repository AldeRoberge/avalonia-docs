# Markup Extensions and Avalonia XAML

This topic introduces the concept of markup extensions for XAML, including their syntax rules, purpose, and the class object model that underlies them. Markup extensions are a general feature of the XAML language and of the .NET implementation of XAML services. This topic specifically details markup extensions for use in Avalonia XAML.

## XAML Processors and Markup Extensions
Generally speaking, a XAML parser can either interpret an attribute value as a literal string that can be converted to a primitive, or convert it to an object by some means. One such means is by referencing a type converter; this is documented in the topic [TypeConverters and XAML](/docs/concepts/xaml/typeconverters-and-xaml.md). However, there are scenarios where different behavior is required. For example, a XAML processor can be instructed that a value of an attribute should not result in a new object in the object graph. Instead, the attribute should result in an object graph that makes a reference to an already constructed object in another part of the graph, or a static object. Another scenario is that a XAML processor can be instructed to use a syntax that provides non-default arguments to the constructor of an object. These are the types of scenarios where a markup extension can provide the solution.

## Basic Markup Extension Syntax
A markup extension can be implemented to provide values for properties in an attribute usage, properties in a property element usage, or both.

When used to provide an attribute value, the syntax that distinguishes a markup extension sequence to a XAML processor is the presence of the opening and closing curly braces ( &#123; and &#125;). The type of markup extension is then identified by the string token immediately following the opening curly brace.

When used in property element syntax, a markup extension is visually the same as any other element used to provide a property element value: a XAML element declaration that references the markup extension class as an element, enclosed within angle brackets (&lt; &gt;).

## Avalonia-Specific Markup Extensions
A MarkupExtension allows code-based customization of setter logic to a target property in a convenient, reusable syntax within XAML. Curly braces are used to differentiate the usage from plain text.

### StaticResource
```StaticResource``` provides a value for a property by substituting the value of an already defined resource. A StaticResource evaluation is ultimately made at XAML load time and does not have access to the object graph at run time. 

### DynamicResource
```DynamicResource``` provides a value for a property by deferring that value to be a run-time reference to a resource. A dynamic resource reference forces a new lookup each time that such a resource is accessed and has access to the object graph at run time. In order to get this access, DynamicResource concept is supported by dependency properties in the WPF property system, and evaluated expressions. Therefore you can only use DynamicResource for a dependency property target. 

### Binding
```Binding``` provides a data-bound value for a property, utilising a compiled expression to enhance performance and type safety.By compiling the binding expressions, it ensures faster execution and immediate feedback on binding errors at compile time, which reduces runtime issues.

### CompiledBinding
```CompiledBinding``` provides a data bound value for a property, using the data context that applies to the parent object at run time. This markup extension is relatively complex, because it enables a substantial inline syntax for specifying a data binding.

### ReflectionBinding
```ReflectionBinding``` provides a data-bound value for a property by utilising reflection to dynamically resolve the binding at runtime. By using reflection, it offers the ability to bind to properties without requiring them to be known at compile time, thus supporting more dynamic and adaptable binding scenarios.

### TemplateBinding
```TemplateBinding``` enables a control template to use values for templated properties that come from object-model-defined properties of the class that will use the template. In other words, the property within the template definition can access a context that only exists once the template is applied.

When you're creating a control template and you want to bind to the templated parent you can use:

```xml
<TextBlock Name="tb" Text="{TemplateBinding Caption}"/>

<!-- Which is the same as -->
<TextBlock Name="tb" Text="{Binding Caption, RelativeSource={RelativeSource TemplatedParent}}"/>
```
Learn more in [How To Create Templated Controls](/docs/guides/custom-controls/how-to-create-templated-controls#data-binding).

### OnPlatform
``OnPlatform``` allows properties to be set conditionally based on the platform on which the application is running. This markup extension is particularly useful for creating cross-platform applications, enabling developers to specify different values or behaviours depending on the target platform.

You can specify values for each platform and a default value that will be used if no specific platform match is found:
```xml
<TextBlock Text="{OnPlatform Default='Unknown', Windows='Im Windows', macOS='Im macOS', Linux='Im Linux'}"/>
```

Alternatively, you can use constructor syntax to define the default value directly, skipping ```Default``` keyword. Platform-specific properties still need to be defined:
```xml
<TextBlock Text="{OnPlatform 'Hello World', Android='Im Android'}"/>
````
You can use this markup extension with any other type, not only strings:

```
<Border Height="{OnPlatform 10, Windows=50.5}"/>
```


### OnFormFactor
```OnFormFactor``` functions similarly to the ```OnPlatform```, however, instead of defining values based on the platform, ```OnFormFactor``` allows values to be set based on the deviceâ€™s form factor, such as ```Desktop``` and ```Mobile```. This is particularly useful for creating adaptive user interfaces that cater to different device types.
```xml
<UserControl xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml">
    <TextBlock Text="{OnFormFactor 'Default value', Mobile='Im Mobile', Desktop='Im Desktop'}"/>
</UserControl>
```


## Compiler intrinsics
These technically fall outside of ```MarkupExtension```s as part of the XAML compiler, but the XAML syntax is the same.

* ```x:Type``` supplies the Type object for the named type. This facility is used most frequently in styles and templates. 
* ```x:Static``` produces static values. The values come from value-type code entities that are not directly the type of a target property's value, but can be evaluated to that type. 
* ```x:Null``` specifies null as a value for a property and can be used either for attributes or property element values. 
* ```x:Array``` provides support for creation of general arrays in XAML syntax, for cases where the collection support provided by WPF base elements and control models is deliberately not used.

The ```x:True``` and ```x:False``` literals have use cases where the target binding property is ```object``` and you need to provide a boolean. In these scenarios that lack type information, providing "True" remains a ```string```.

```xml
<Button Command="{Binding SetStateCommand}" CommandParameter="{x:True}" />
```

:::note
The ```x:``` prefix is used for the typical XAML namespace mapping of the XAML language intrinsics, in the root element of a XAML file or production. For example, the .NET templates for Avalonia applications initiate a XAML file using this x: mapping. You could choose a different prefix token in your own XAML namespace mapping, but this documentation will assume the default x: mapping as a means of identifying those entities that are a defined part of the XAML namespace for the XAML language, as opposed to the Avalonia default namespace or other XAML namespaces not related to a specific framework.
