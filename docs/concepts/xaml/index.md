# XAML

Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) is a markup language for declarative application programming. Avalonia implements a XAML processor implementation and provides XAML language support. The Avalonia types are implemented such that they can provide the required type backing for a XAML representation. In general, you can create the majority of your Avalonia application UI in XAML markup.
